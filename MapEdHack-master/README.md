# MapEd


MapEd is a resource platform that provides the location of programs, trainings, and organizations that serve as an alternative to college for students in North Carolina. This application was created with my team for the 2020 Hope Hack. MapEd was developed to be viewed on a laptop or a desktop since students are often prompted to research college choices in school. When the application is loaded, users will be greeted with a one page application that holds information about MapEd and how it works. The application also holds a form that collects the information the user enters and stores it within a database.

Clone and download this repo to your local machine. Then install the packages using the command "npm install" 

## Running the Application 

After all the packages have been installed, open the project from the terminal using the command "node index.js" or nodemon if it is installed on your local machine. This will start the sever and render the main page as well.

To stop the server from running and close the main page, use "control/command + C" in the terminal.
