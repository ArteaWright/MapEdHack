MapEd is a resource platform that provides the location of programs, trainings, and organizations that serve as an alternative to college for students in North Carolina. This application was created with my team for the 2020 Hope Hack. MapEd was developed to be viewed on a laptop or a desktop since students are often prompted to research college choices in school. When the application is loaded, users will be greeted with a one page application that holds information about MapEd and how it works. The application also holds a form that collects the information the user enters and stores it within a database.
